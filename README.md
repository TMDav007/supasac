## 🔄 Git Workflow & Branching Strategy

### 📌 Active Branch: `develop`

All code must be merged into the `develop` branch until further notice.

### 🌿 Feature Branches

* Use a feature branch for new features or fixes.
* Branch naming: `feature/<short-description>` or `bugfix/<short-description>`

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-login
```

### ✅ Pull Request Target

Pull requests must be opened **against `develop`**, not `main`.
